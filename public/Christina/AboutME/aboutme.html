Burke HS, with a world of possibilities ahead of me. My birthday is on December 21st, 2005, and I’m proud of my Haitian roots. Fluent in Haitian Creole, French, and English, I’m equipped to embrace the global stage of international Business that i’m so drown to. Music flows through my life as I play the saxophone and violin, and I love expressing myself through dance, hanging out with friends, and shopping. Now, I’m challenging my creativity into building my very first website. </div>
