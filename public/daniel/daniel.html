  <section id="about">
    <p class="about_text">Hi, I'm Daniel, a high school student born in 07 currently due to be a junior this coming school year. Born and raised in Massachusetts, I grew up developing an affinity and love for the sciences. For the past few years and for the rest of my time in high school, my goal is to get a glimpse of and gain experience of different professions in an attempt to narrow down what it is I want to do for my future. This year, I have decided to join AFH and their creative technology studio which has enabled me to<br> learn more about programming. Next year, we'll see what happens. What new things I'll try, what programs I'll join and if I have successfully chosen a career for my future.</p>
